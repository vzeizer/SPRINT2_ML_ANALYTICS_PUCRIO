# SPRINT **Analytics â€“ Descriptive and Predictive**. **MVP Project: Predicting Churn**

- **The Machine Learning problem to be tackled is a Time Series Classification to predict Customer Churn over time.**

**Churn rate**, also known as attrition rate, is a crucial metric used by businesses to measure the rate at which customers or subscribers discontinue their relationship with a service over a specific period of time. It is commonly expressed as a percentage and is calculated by dividing the number of customers lost during a given period by the total number of customers at the beginning of that period.

**Limitations and Considerations of Churn Rate:**

1. **Definition Consistency**: There may be variations in how churn is defined across different industries and companies. It's important to have a consistent definition of churn to ensure accurate and meaningful comparisons.

2. **Time Frame**: The choice of time frame for calculating churn can significantly impact the churn rate. Shorter time frames may result in more fluctuations, while longer time frames may obscure trends or changes in customer behavior.

3. **Customer Segmentation**: Not all customers are equal, and their behaviors may vary based on factors such as demographics, usage patterns, and tenure. Analyzing churn without considering these segments may overlook important insights.

4. **Customer Acquisition**: High churn rates can be offset by acquiring new customers. Therefore, it's essential to consider both churn and customer acquisition costs to evaluate the *overall health of a business*.

6. **Voluntary vs. Involuntary Churn**: Churn can be classified as voluntary (e.g., customers canceling subscriptions) or involuntary (e.g., customers moving away). **Understanding the reasons behind churn can help tailor retention strategies effectively.**

7. **Lagging Indicator**: **Churn rate is a lagging indicator, meaning it reflects past behavior rather than predicting future actions. To address this limitation, businesses may complement churn rate analysis with predictive modeling techniques to anticipate and prevent churn proactively.**

8. **Data Quality**: Churn rate calculations rely on accurate and reliable data. Poor data quality, such as incomplete or outdated customer records, can lead to inaccuracies in churn rate measurements.

9. **External Factors**: External factors beyond the company's control, such as market competition, regulatory changes, or economic conditions, can influence churn rates. These factors should be considered when interpreting churn rate trends.

In summary, while churn rate is a valuable metric for assessing customer retention and loyalty, it is essential to interpret it in context and consider its limitations and nuances to derive actionable insights effectively.

## **Conclusions and Discussion**

- **ANSWERING THE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE DATASET**:

1. What are the most important factors/features that are responsible for customer churn? And for normal/not churned events?

*Ans.:* For normal events, it was shown by SHAP analysis that the lagged features of "segment_code" are the most importante along with "group_code" related features. For churn events, it was observed by SHAP analysis that the lagged features of "segment_code" are the most importante along with "group_code" related features, however, in comparison to the former situation (normal outcomes), the "group_code" play a more significant role in these predictions.

2. Which are the segments more prone to churn outcomes?

*Ans.:*  **It was shown that segment numbers 2 and 3 have high churn rates.** So, it can be a good idea to take a careful at these segment in order to find policies to minimize churn.

3. Which are the groups more prone to churn outcomes?

*Ans.:* It was shown that **groups 1 and 2 have a very high churn rate**. Therefore, it might be interesting to take a careful look at these groups and use strategies to minimize churn especially for them.

4. Which are the sellers more prone to churn outcomes?

*Ans.:* It was shown that sales channels number **2, 4,7 and 9 have a churn rate much higher than not churned events**, so, special attention should be paid to these sales channels in order to minimize churn outcomes.

5. Which are the sellers that are the most relevant in order to take into account when using ML methods?

*Ans.:* As in the previous question, these are the sales channels number **2, 4,7 and 9 have the highest number of overall events**; we just kept for further analysis sales channels with **number of events greater than 200**.

6. How is the distribution of events, churned or not churned? And the distribution throughout the years? Are there specific years that might be showing data drift?

*Ans.:* In the dataset, approximately 80% are normal events, while 20% are churn events. It was shown that years 2016, 2017 and 2018 seem also to have a churn rate distribution different than the previous years. This is because that from 2008 up to 2015 the churn rate was augmenting quasi-linearly, and ,after these years, it is not anymore.

7. Which is the best model to describe the data according to the Area Under the ROC Curve? Which are the most important features in the overall predictions of the dataset? Are lagged features relevant to best model this data?

*Ans.:* **The best model was a Random Forest Model with Robust Scaler Normalization, showing an AUC close to 1.0 in the Validation Set and 0.82 in the Testing Set**. The Precision and Recall scores were also significantly lower in the Testing Set, even though, this is a good model concerning the complexity of the data. The main features responsible for the outcomes of the model were the **"group_code" and "segment_code"** lagged features according to the Feature Importances analysis of the Random Forest Classifier. This confirms the hypothesis that lagged features are really important when handling time series and justifies their creations prior to data modeling. Other models have been tested (not shown), such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees and SVM's. However, either was the model's performance poor or it took too long to train without relevant results.

8. What is the performance of the best model in the training and testing data? Has there been some degree of underfitting or overfitting?

*Ans.:* The model had an AUC close to 1.0 in the Validation Set and 0.82 in the Testing Set. This somehow shows an overfitting of the model - the confusion matrices corrobotared it -, which can be explained by temporal data drift in the Testing Set (years 2016 and 2017 were in the testing set). Underfitting was not detected.

9. There could have been used more advanced modeling of the data, such as ensemble and stacking? Is this model strategy worth it in this specific problem?  

*Ans.:* **There could have been created more complex models from the algorithms used in the Pipeline by using Ensemble or stacking techniques. However, the gain in performance would be low in comparison to the complexity of this new model. Moreover, if one wants to augment the predictive power of the current model, one could have used more lagged features in the Feature Selection procedure to better fit and evaluate the model**;

10. How does the most relevant features contribute to churn or normal/not churned outcomes? Are lagged features of relevant impact in these specific prediction outcomes?

*Ans.:* It was shown by SHAP analysis that "segment_code" and its lagged features are most responsible for normal events, even though some of them have a slightly contribution to churn events. "group_code" and its lagged features have a small impact in the model and this contribution is towards normal events.
For churn events, the the top "group_code" lagged features tend to have a contribution more prone to churn events, while "segment_code" are more prone to do the opposite.



## **Future Works and Improvements**
- To improve this project, it is intended to:

1. deploy the model and create an user interface using streamlit;
2. use **automated machine learning** packages, such as h20 and Auto ML, to sweep over an wider range of models when modeling the dataset;
3. use **lagged features composed of the target variable** when modeling the data. This approach can be complex to tackle when evaluating the model in the testing set, because one has to predict churn events over specific time windows;
4. use other variants of TimeSeriesSplit methods to temporally cross-validate the model;
5. experiment a greater variety of models and a larget set of hyperparameters to tune the models. This can be done with Bayesian search in a smart and quicker way.
